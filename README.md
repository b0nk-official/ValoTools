# ValoTools
## DISCONTINUED
A multi-purpose tool for Valorant.

Check releases for an executable file.
If you are going to use the source code to run it, use text_ui or graphic_ui. (you can probably assume which is which)

Viruses might be detected, but only because it is a code file from a unrecognized source.
If your antivirus deletes it, turn it off temporarily and then add an exclusion to the file when its downloaded.
Don't trust me? Check the file on https://www.virustotal.com and see that most antiviruses mark the file as clean.

### TEXT UI IS WINDOWS ONLY
If this is not ran on Windows, a lot of cosmetic features will be broken like the window title and keeping the text cleaned up.
Graphical UI should work just fine, though.

### VERSION NUMBERS ACCORDING TO ME
Versions will go like this! The first number changes after a huge update or big feature is added.
The second number changes after a feature addition.
The third number changes after an addition to an already existing feature or a bug fix.
